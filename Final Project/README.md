# Project Overview

This project is performed upon the Personal Details module. The Personal Details module contains all of an employee's personal information and data. This is an incredibly important page as the data contained in this page is used for other key modules throughout the OrangeHRM system. It is crucial that this page is filled in completely and accurately as possible.

The project will be split into 2 sections:  testing section and SQL section.

Tools used: JIRA, Zephyr Squad, MySQL Workbench.

# 1.	Testing Section

## 1.1.	Test planning

The test plan describes the testing approach, the overall objective and scope of testing the Personal Details module from the OrangeHRM application. 

### 1.1.1.	Test Objectives

The objective of the test is to verify that the functionalities of Personal Details module work according to the specifications. Conduct testing to verify the quality of the website and ensure that the website is released without any defects.

### 1.1.2.	Functional specifications

The functionality of this module spans through the entire system, making information available anywhere, anytime.

The personal details section can be accessed from the My Info module.

The personal details of an employee can be added, edited and deleted in this section.

Once you have completed click ‘'Save”.

You can also add blood type from a drop - down menu and add/edit/delete attachments.

### 1.1.3.	Roles and persons allocated

Project Manager – Ioana Barsan

Product Owner – Mihai Turcu

Software Developer – Vlad Oancea

QA Engineer – Matyas Melinda

### 1.1.4.	Entry criteria

*	Planning phase has been completed
*	Functional specifications are defined and approved
*	Test cases are developed and ready
*	System testing phase has been successful completed

### 1.1.5.	Exit criteria

*	All tests have been executed
*	All critical test cases are passed
*	All critical and high priority bugs have been fixed and closed
*	Deadline has been reached

### 1.1.6.	Test scope

All the feature of Personal Details module defined in specific requirements needs to be tested: Functional testing, GUI and API testing.

Non-functional testing like stress and performance testing are not in scope.

### 1.1.7.	Risks detected

Project risks: testing environment is unavailable, short time frame available for testing, lack of communication with team members.

Product risks: lack of dismissive button (cancel/reset), which prevents unwanted changes to the system.

## 1.2.	Test monitoring and control

Different monitoring reports were generated in order to track current progress of testing activity and to take corrective actions if needed.  The following reports were generated on 15th of September 2022.

## 1.3.	Test Analysis

Based on the requirements of Personal Details Module the following test conditions were identified:

*	Complete only required fields and verify that the personal details are saved/updated
*	Complete all fields and verify that the personal details are saved/updated
*	Leave required fields empty and verify that personal details cannot be saved/updated
*	Edit editable fields and validate that the fields are edited/saved/updated
*	Edit editable fields and check that changes can be canceled/reset 
*	Upload supported file/files and verify that attachment/attachments are saved
*	Upload supported file/files and check that these can be modified and deleted

## 1.4.	 Test design

The following test cases were derived from test conditions and were created in Zephyr Squad. Test design techniques used for determining test cases were boundary analysis, equivalence partitioning and use case testing.
